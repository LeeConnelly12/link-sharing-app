## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
-   Drag and drop links to reorder them
-   Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
-   Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
-   Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   **Bonus**: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
-   **Bonus**: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
